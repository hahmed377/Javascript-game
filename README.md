### Functionality
The game i had built had using a very basic format where there would be a home page which would have the title of the game followed by some buttons that would lead the player of the game to where they wanted to go. There was an instructions page as well as a start game button where the user could launch the game before they read the instructions. There is also a leaderboard button which will display the player one and player two scores. The html page had structured the page the way i wanted it and the css stylesheet was used to modify how the game looked when played. The Javascript file would contain the variables and use functions that would allow the game to work.

## How to play the game

The game starts with the user greeted by the home screen and from here they can go straight into the game or go to instructions if they want to know how the game works.

Once the player clicks on start game they are shown a timer for five seconds and where the ships are located in the grids. When the timer runs out the ships will disappear and the user will need to remember where they are located and try and hit as many ships before the attempts runs out. After the first player the grid resets and new ships are displayed in new random positions and the second player would need to try and beat the score of the first player and the score will be displayed in the leaderboards.
